# Prism Help Guide

A complete guide to using Prism, the self-hosted family dashboard.

---

## Getting Started

### What is Prism?

Prism is a free, self-hosted family dashboard that brings together calendars, tasks, chores, shopping lists, meals, photos, and more into one shared hub. It's designed for always-on displays (tablets, kiosks, TVs) with a PIN-based login system that works for all ages.

### First-Time Setup

1. **Add family members** in Settings > Family Members
2. **Set PINs** for each member in Settings > Security
3. **Connect integrations** (Google Calendar, Microsoft To Do, OneDrive, weather)
4. **Customize your dashboard** layout using the Edit button
5. **Install as PWA** on phones and tablets for quick access

### Logging In

Tap a family member's avatar, then enter their 4-digit PIN. The PIN auto-submits after 4 digits. Keyboard input works too (0-9, Backspace, Enter).

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the main hub, displaying live data through customizable widgets on a grid layout.

### Available Widgets

- **Clock** - Current time
- **Weather** - Temperature, conditions, humidity, wind (requires OpenWeatherMap)
- **Calendar** - Upcoming events with multiple view options (agenda, day, week, month)
- **Tasks** - To-do items with completion status
- **Chores** - Pending and due chores
- **Shopping** - Active shopping list items
- **Meals** - Weekly meal plan
- **Messages** - Family message board
- **Photos** - Rotating photo slideshow
- **Points** - Goal progress with point waterfall
- **Birthdays** - Upcoming family birthdays
- **Wishes** - Family member wish lists
- **Bus Tracker** - School bus arrival predictions

### Editing the Layout

1. Tap the **grid icon** (four squares) in the dashboard header to enter edit mode (parent only)
2. **Drag** widgets to reposition, **resize** by dragging corner handles
3. Use the **Widgets** button to show/hide widgets and adjust their coordinates
4. Click a widget to select it, then use the **properties toolbar** to adjust background color, opacity, outline, text color, and text size
5. Load pre-designed arrangements from the **Templates** button
6. **Save** to overwrite the current layout, or use the dropdown arrow for **Save As** to create a named copy

### Preview & Validation

Click **Preview** in the editor toolbar to see a miniature map of your layout. It highlights widget positions, shows screen safe zones for different display sizes, and flags any issues like overlapping or undersized widgets. Click on the preview map to scroll the grid to that area.

### Measure Mode

Click **Measure** (or press Ctrl+Shift+M) to temporarily hide the editor toolbar and see your layout as it will actually appear. Use the "Show Nav / Hide Nav" toggle to check how it looks with and without the navigation sidebar. This is useful for fine-tuning layouts on dedicated displays.

For a permanent clean look, enable **Auto-Hide Navigation** in Settings > Display. The nav and toolbar will automatically hide after a period of inactivity and reappear on click or keyboard input.

### Screensaver Layout

Each dashboard has its own screensaver layout. In edit mode, click the **Screensaver** button to switch to editing the screensaver widget arrangement. The screensaver activates after a configurable idle period (Settings > Display) and shows a photo slideshow with your chosen widgets overlaid.

Configure in Settings > Display:
- **Screensaver timeout** — How long before it activates
- **Photo rotation interval** — How often photos change
- **Pin a photo** — Use one static image instead of rotating

### Import, Export & Community Layouts

- **Export** — Copy your current layout as JSON to share with others (More > Export)
- **Import** — Paste a layout JSON to load someone else's design (More > Import)
- **Share** — Submit your layout to the Prism community gallery via GitHub (More > Share)
- **Community** — Browse and apply layouts shared by other Prism users from the Community button in the editor toolbar

### Multiple Dashboards

Create separate dashboards for different rooms or displays. Click the dashboard name dropdown in the editor toolbar to switch between dashboards or create new ones.
- Default dashboard lives at `/`
- Named dashboards get URLs like `/d/kitchen` or `/d/living-room`
- Each has independent widget layout, screensaver layout, and orientation (landscape/portrait)
- Bookmark a dashboard URL on a dedicated device for instant access

### Orientation

Toggle between **Landscape** and **Portrait** mode using the orientation button in the editor toolbar. This controls which screen safe zone guides are shown and how the layout is optimized for your display.

### Mobile Dashboard

On phones, the dashboard shows a simplified single-column layout with summary cards for each feature. Tap any card to navigate to the full page.

## Calendar

### Setting Up Calendars

Connect your calendars in **Settings > Connected Accounts** via Google Calendar (OAuth) or CalDAV (Nextcloud, Radicale, Baikal, Synology). Once connected, individual calendars appear in **Settings > Calendars** where you can:

- **Enable/disable** individual calendars from showing on the dashboard
- **Assign to a family member** — each calendar is linked to a person or marked as "Family" (shared)
- **Set display names** — customize how a calendar appears in the UI
- **Change colors** — override the default color for any calendar

### Calendar Groups & Columns

In Day and List views, events are organized into **columns by calendar group**. Groups are created automatically based on your calendar assignments:

- The **Family** group always appears first (for shared/family calendars)
- **Person columns** appear after Family, ordered by the family member sort order in Settings > Family Members
- Reorder family members in Settings to change the column order
- Use the **Merge/Split** toggle to combine all events into a single column or separate by person

Filter buttons at the top of the calendar let you show/hide specific calendar groups. Click **All** to show everything.

### Color Coding

Events inherit their color from the calendar source they belong to. When calendars are assigned to family members, each person's events appear in their column with the calendar's color. You can customize colors per calendar in Settings > Calendars.

### Views

- **Agenda** - Upcoming events in a scrollable list
- **Day** - Hourly breakdown with side-by-side calendar columns
- **Week** - 7-day grid with hourly rows
- **List** - Vertical week view with events listed per day
- **Multi-Week** - 1W, 2W, 3W, or 4W configurable views
- **Month** - Full month grid
- **3 Month** - Three months side-by-side

The grid lines toggle (grid icon) shows or hides cell borders across all grid-based views.

### Calendar Notes

Click the **sticky note icon** to show a notes panel alongside Day or List views. Notes are day-tied, shared across the family, and support formatting:
- **Ctrl+B** Bold, **Ctrl+I** Italic, **Ctrl+U** Underline
- **Ctrl+Shift+S** Strikethrough, **Ctrl+Shift+L** Bullet list
- Type `- ` at the start of a line to auto-convert to a bullet

### Hidden Hours

Hide a time range from day and week views (e.g., midnight to 6 AM). The remaining hours auto-resize to fill the available space. Configure the range in Settings > Display > Calendar Hours, and toggle visibility with the clock button in calendar views.

### Navigation

- **Previous/Next** arrows to move between periods
- **Today** button to jump back to current date
- **Swipe** left/right on touch devices to navigate

---

## Tasks

Create and manage to-do items with optional assignment, due dates, priorities, and categories.

- **Add** via the "Add Task" button or inline text input
- **Complete** by tapping the checkbox
- **Filter** by person, priority, or category
- **Sort** by due date, priority, or category
- **Group by Person** to see tasks organized by family member
- **Sync** with Microsoft To Do (configure in Settings > Task Sync)

---

## Chores

Family chores with an approval workflow and point system.

### How It Works

1. A parent creates a chore with a frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) and point value
2. A child marks it complete - it enters "Pending Approval" state
3. A parent approves it - points are awarded and `nextDue` advances
4. If a parent completes it themselves, it's auto-approved

### Reset Day

Each chore can have a custom reset day:
- **Weekly/Biweekly**: Which day of the week (Sun-Sat, defaults to Sunday)
- **Monthly/Quarterly**: Which day of the month (1-28)
- **Annually**: Specific date (MM-DD format)

Set this in the Add/Edit Chore modal.

### Views

- **Group by Person** - Cards per family member showing their chores
- **List view** - All chores in a sortable list
- **History** - Recent completions with approval status

---

## Goals & Points

Set family goals that children work toward by earning points from chore completions.

### Setup

1. Go to Goals page, tap **Add Goal**
2. Set a name, emoji, and point cost
3. Choose **Recurring** (resets weekly/monthly/yearly) or **One-time** (accumulates until redeemed)
4. Set priority order - points fill higher-priority goals first

### How Points Work

Points are earned from approved chore completions. The **waterfall** system allocates points in priority order:
1. Highest priority recurring goal gets filled first
2. Overflow goes to the next goal
3. Non-recurring goals accumulate across weeks

### Celebrations

When a goal is fully achieved, a seasonal celebration animation plays:
- Valentine's week: Hearts
- St. Patrick's week: Leprechaun & gold
- Easter week: Easter bunny & eggs
- Mother's Day week: Spring flowers
- Memorial Day week: Flags & stars
- July 4th week: Bald eagle & fireworks
- Halloween week: Jack-o-lantern & bats
- Thanksgiving week: Cornucopia
- Christmas week: Santa's gift bag
- New Year's: Fireworks & confetti
- All other times: Trophy & confetti

## Settings Reference

### Family Members
Add, edit, remove family members. Set names, colors, avatars, and roles.

### Security
- **Member PINs** - Set or change PINs for each family member
- **API Tokens** - Generate tokens for external integrations (Home Assistant, scripts)

### Connected Accounts
Connect Google (Calendar), Microsoft (To Do, OneDrive), and CalDAV servers via OAuth or credentials.

### CalDAV (Nextcloud, Radicale, Baikal, Synology)
Connect any CalDAV-compatible server to sync calendar events and tasks:
- Provide server URL, username, and password/app-token
- Prism discovers available calendars automatically
- **Events** (VEVENT) sync into Prism's calendar views
- **Tasks** (VTODO) sync into Prism's task list (if the calendar supports it)
- Read-only sync — credentials stored encrypted
- Common URLs: Nextcloud `/remote.php/dav`, Radicale `/`, Baikal `/dav.php`, Synology `:5001/caldav/`

**Proton Calendar**: Proton does not offer a public API or native CalDAV endpoint. If you run Proton Mail Bridge on a local machine, it exposes a CalDAV interface that Prism can connect to. Both Prism and Bridge must be on the same network. Note: Bridge only exposes calendar events — Proton does not support task (VTODO) sync via any protocol.
